/*Create a new branch off of your day1 branch called 
takehome. On that branch, write some JavaScript that 
logs a message to the console describing what you want 
to get out of this class and your favorite hobby.
Add, commit, and push your code to your takehome branch.
If you haven't already, add me to your repository as a 
collaborator and let me know you're done with the take 
home on Slack.*/
